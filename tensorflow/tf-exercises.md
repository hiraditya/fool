# Exercise
---------------
Create a neural network that is capable of finding the volume of a cylinder given the radius of its base (r) and its height (h).

Create a neural network that is capable of finding the volume of a cylinder given the radius of its base (r) and its height (h). Assume that the radius and height of the cylinder are both in the range 0.5 to 2.0. Unlike in the challenge exercise for b_estimator.ipynb, assume that your measurements of r, h and V are all rounded off to the nearest 0.1. Simulate the necessary training dataset. This time, you will need a lot more data to get a good predictor.
