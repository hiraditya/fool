2. recursive descent parser
3. Given a target number and a single number, write a program to find the shortest path to calculate the target number by applying "+-*/" operations to the single number. No parentheses. For example, if we have target number=26 and single number=3 return 3 * 3 * 3 - 3 / 3. https://pastebin.com/M4CgYJ5b

25. Given a Pattern and a dictionary, print out all the strings that match the pattern. 
where a character in the pattern is mapped uniquely to a character in the dictionary ( this is what i was given first).
  e.g 1. ("abc" , <"cdf", "too", "hgfdt" ,"paa">) -> output = "cdf"
      2. ("acc" , <"cdf", "too", "hgfdt" ,"paa">) -> output = "too", "paa"
