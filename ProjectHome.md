The aim is to provide facilities for the functional programming enthusiasts to write in C++. Future developments may include functionalities that might not have look and feeling of functional programming.

Other additions:

1. Wrappers to interface with clang front end.

2. POSIX Thread wrappers.

3. Containers (Stack and Queue) using dynamic as well as constant sized containers. Constant sized containers offers good run-time performance.

4. A set of utility functions for STL containers and other standard library data structures (e.g., print, sort etc.)

5. Very naive (and erroneous) client server implementation.
